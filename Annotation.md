# Metagenome Annotation

The annotation includes gene predication (tRNA, rRNA, CRISPR, signal peptide, transmembrane helices, and protein coding genes), taxonomic assignment, and gene function annotation. I used the first version of our in house tool called Metaerg [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00999/full](metaerg).
